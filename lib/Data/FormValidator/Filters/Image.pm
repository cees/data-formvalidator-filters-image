=head1 NAME

Data::FormValidator::Filters::Image - Filter that allows you to shrink incoming image uploads using Data::FormValidator

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Data::FormValidator::Filters::Image qw( image_filter );

    # Build a Data::FormValidator Profile:
    my $my_profile = {
        required => qw( uploaded_image ),
        field_filters => {
            uploaded_image => image_filter(max_width => 800, max_height => 600),
        },
    };

    # Be sure to use a CGI.pm object as the form input
    # when using this filter
    my $q = new CGI;
    my $dfv = Data::FormValidator->check($q,$my_profile);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Many users when uploading image files never bother to shrink them down to a reasonable size.
Instead of declining the upload because it is too large, this module will shrink the image
down to a reasonable size during the form validation stage.

The filter will try to fail gracefully by leaving the upload as is if the image resize
operation fails.

=head2 image_filter( max_width => $width, max_height => $height )

This will create a filter that will reduce the size of an image that is
being uploaded so that it is bounded by the width and height provided.
The image will be scaled in a way that will not distort or stretch
the image.

 example:

 - upload an image that is 800 x 600
 - specify a max width of 100 and max height of 100

 The resulting image will be 100 x 75, since that is the
 largest scaled image we can create that is still within
 the bounds we specified.
